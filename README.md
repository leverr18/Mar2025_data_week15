Data Bootcamp Week Fifteen Leaflet

This project is a web-based interactive map that shows earthquake data and tectonic plate boundaries using Leaflet and GeoJSON data. Users can see the location, magnitude, and depth of each earthquake, with visual indicators like color and size.

This project displays a map with earthquakes and tectonic plates using circle markers to display the severity through color and size of bubble.

I learned how to use leaflet and fetch GeoJSON data, displaying through HTML, css, and javascript.

This was a really cool challenge to learn how to work with real-world data and visualize it on a map, really helping me to understand GeoJSON, data-driven styling, and how to use JavaScript to fetch and display live data.
